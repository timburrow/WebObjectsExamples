<h1 class="topictitle1">Getting a nested connection</h1>



<div><p>When you are executing a method within SQL, that method might need
to reuse the current connection to the database in order to execute more SQL
statements. Such a connection is called a<em> nested connection</em>. The way
for a method to get a nested connection is to issue a connection request using
the connection URL.</p>

<pre>jdbc:default:connection</pre>

<p>URL attributes are not supported as part of this connection URL. Any URL
attributes specified in a Properties object, user name, or password that are
passed to a <em>java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection()</em> call will be ignored.</p>
