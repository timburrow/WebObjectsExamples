<h1 class="topictitle1">Expressions on LONGs</h1>



<div><p><span>Derby</span> permits
expressions on LONG VARCHAR; however LONG VARCHAR data types are not allowed
in the following clauses, operations, constraints, functions, and predicates.</p>

<div class="p"> <ul>
<li>GROUP BY clauses</li>

<li>ORDER BY clauses</li>

<li>JOIN operations</li>

<li>PRIMARY KEY constraints</li>

<li>Foreign KEY constraints</li>

<li>UNIQUE key constraints</li>

<li>MIN aggregate function</li>

<li>MAX aggregate function</li>

<li>[NOT] IN predicate</li>

<li>UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT operators</li>

</ul>
SQL99 also places some restrictions on expressions on LONG types.</div>
