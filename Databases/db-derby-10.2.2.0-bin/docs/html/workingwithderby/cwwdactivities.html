<dd><p><strong>Activity 1:</strong>  Use the  Derby <samp class="codeph">ij</samp> tool to load
the Derby embedded driver and start the Derby database engine. Create the
database firstdb and the table FIRSTTABLE. Use a few basic SQL commands to
insert and select data. The Derby message log <samp class="codeph">derby.log</samp> and
the database directories and files are introduced.</p>
</dd>

<dd class="ddexpand"><p><strong>Activity 2:</strong> Use Derby within a Client-Server configuration.
Start the Derby Network Server which will embed the Derby engine. In a separate
process use the Derby <samp class="codeph">ij</samp> tool to load the Derby client driver
and connect to the Server. Create a database called <samp class="codeph">seconddb</samp> and
the table SECONDTABLE. Use a few basic SQL commands to insert and select data.</p>
</dd>

<dd class="ddexpand"><p><strong>Activity 3:</strong> Load the Derby database engine from a simple Java
JDBC program. Use the embedded driver to create the database jdbcDemoDB and
the WISH_LIST table. Populate the table with text entered from the keyboard
then view a list of the records in the table. Walk through the code to understand
the basic structure of a JDBC program that accesses a Derby database. The <samp class="codeph">CLASSPATH</samp> variable
and connection URL attribute <samp class="codeph">;shutdown=true</samp> are introduced.</p>
</dd>

<dd class="ddexpand"><p><strong>Activity 4:</strong> Modify the Java JDBC program to load the client
driver and connect to the Derby Network Server. Compile the altered program
and test that it operates as it did in the previous activity.</p>

To help you get up and running with Derby as quickly as possible, this self-study guide highlights some of the more important features of Derby through a series of activities designed to demonstrate the use of Derby in embedded and client-server configurations. After performing these activities, you will find Derby to be an easy to use and fully functional RDBMS. This section provides a brief description of Derby, followed by information on the skills and software required to perform the activities presented in this document, and ends with a brief description of what is presented by each of the Working With Derby activities.">Introduction and prerequisites</a></div>
