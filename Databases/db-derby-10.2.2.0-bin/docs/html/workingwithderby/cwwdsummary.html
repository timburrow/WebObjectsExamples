<div><p>Congratulations on completing the activities in this workbook.
You now have experience with using Derby in both the embedded and Client-Server 
architectures. With this basic knowledge you are ready to begin using
Derby to address your own specific needs. We recommend visiting the Apache
Derby website as your next step in learning about this lightweight and powerful
tool.</p>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Activities Summary</h4><p>We hope you have found these
activities useful in understanding the steps needed to create and access Derby
databases. Though simple to setup and use you will find that Derby has the
features and reliability of much larger database systems. The examples presented
here do not begin to scratch the surface of what can be done. Please take
a few moments to become familiar with the many online resources available
to Derby users and developers by browsing the Derby website at Apache. Whether
you are performing a general evaluation of Derby or have a specific need to
address, the above link is a good stepping stone to finding additional information
of interest. The <a href="http://db.apache.org/derby/quick_start.html">Derby Quick Start page</a> is a good reference page organized
by area of interest. You will find many content rich areas such as the <cite>Derby
Wiki</cite> and the <cite>Derby Users mailing list</cite> available to you.
If you are interested in how others are using Derby see the <cite>Uses of
Derby</cite> page on the WIKI. This page contains informational links to development
projects and products that use Derby. When you implement a system using Derby
please add it to this list.</p>
