<div><p>Welcome to Derby!
To help you get up and running with Derby as quickly as possible,
this self-study guide highlights some of the more important features of Derby
through a series of activities designed to demonstrate the use of Derby in
embedded and client-server configurations.
After performing these activities, you will find Derby to be an easy to use and
fully functional RDBMS.
This section provides a brief description of Derby, followed by information on
the skills and software required to perform the activities presented in this
document, and ends with a brief description of what is presented by each of the
Working With Derby activities.</p>

<div class="section"><p>Derby is a full featured, open source relational database engine.
It is written and implemented completely in Java, and provides users with a
small footprint standards-based database engine that can be tightly embedded
into any Java based solution. Derby ensures data integrity and provides sophisticated
transaction support. In its default configuration there is no separate
database server to be installed or maintained by the end user. For more information
on Derby visit the Derby website at: <a href="http://db.apache.org/derby">http://db.apache.org/derby</a>.</p>
<p>Performing the Working
With Derby activities requires no prior knowledge of Java, JDBC or SQL. Each
Activity Sequence section provides the complete command syntax needed to execute
each operation on a Windows machine or in a UNIX/Linux Korn shell.  This document
demonstrates, but does not teach, the Java, JDBC and SQL presented, so readers
wishing a deeper understanding of these topics will need additional reference
materials.</p>
<div class="p">Performing the Working With Derby activities does require
that Java and Derby software be installed on the computer, and the ability
to enter computer operating system commands. Specifically:<ul>
<li>A Java development kit version 1.3 or higher</li>

<li>The binary (<samp class="codeph">bin</samp>) installation of Apache Derby version
<span>10.2</span></li>

<li>A basic knowledge of the computer command line interface<ul>
<li>how to start a command shell or window</li>

<li>how to navigate the filesystem hierarchy</li>

</ul>
</li>

</ul>
</div>
<p>If unsure about the Java or Derby environments installed, perform
the following steps before attempting the subsequent activities:</p>
</div>

<ol>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Verify that the JAVA_HOME environment variable is set and points
to a Java development kit version 1.3 or higher.</span> Open a command
window and run the command <samp class="codeph">java -version</samp> using the appropriate
syntax for your system: <dl>
<dt class="dlterm">On Windows platforms:</dt>

<dd><hr /><pre><strong>"%JAVA_HOME%\bin\java" -version</strong></pre><hr />
</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">On UNIX Korn Shell platforms:</dt>

<dd><hr /><pre><strong>"$JAVA_HOME/bin/java" -version</strong></pre><hr />
</dd>

</dl>
 The output from the command will look
something like this:<hr /><pre><em>java version "1.4.2_04"  
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.2_04-b05)  
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.2_04-b05, mixed mode)</em></pre><hr />

The output you see
may be different from what is shown here, because the <kbd class="userinput">java -version</kbd> command
outputs vendor-specific information. If the command produced an error or the
version listed is not 1.3 or higher, please install a Java development kit
before continuing.</li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>Verify that the DERBY_HOME environment variable is set and points to
the filesystem path to the root directory of the Derby <span>10.2</span> installation:</span>
 Open a command window and run the appropriate command for your system:
 <dl>
<dt class="dlterm">On Windows platforms:</dt>

<dd><hr /><pre><strong>echo %DERBY_HOME%</strong></pre><hr />
</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">On UNIX Korn Shell platforms:</dt>

<dd><hr /><pre><strong>echo $DERBY_HOME</strong></pre><hr />
</dd>

</dl>


 The output from the command will look something like this:
<hr /><pre><em>Windows: C:\derby
Unix/Linux: /opt/derby</em></pre><hr />

If Derby is not installed or cannot be found, please install a copy now.
The most recent version of Derby can be downloaded from:
<a href="http://db.apache.org/derby/derby_downloads.html">http://db.apache.org/derby/derby_downloads.html</a>.  From the Download page use the link to the 'Latest
Official Release', then locate the <samp class="codeph">bin</samp> distribution (e.g.
db-derby-&lt;version&gt;-bin.zip and db-derby-&lt;version&gt;-bin.tar.gz).
Download the appropriate file for your platform, '-bin.zip' for Windows or
'-bin.tar.gz' for Unix/Linux, and unzip/untar this file. After decompressing
the downloaded file, move the directory created to the filesystem path chosen
to be the root directory of the Derby installation
(e.g. move db-derby-&lt;version&gt;-bin C:\derby).

</li>

</ol>

<div class="section">Anyone having problems with any aspect of these activities can gain
assistance via e-mail by writing to derby-user@db.apache.org.  The questions
and feedback received will be used to make this document even more useful. </div>
