<h1 class="topictitle1">Activity 1: Run SQL using the Embedded driver</h1>



<div><p>In this section the Derby database engine is loaded by the Derby
IJ tool. The Derby embedded driver is used to create and connect to the database
firstdb. A few basic SQL commands are demonstrated.</p>

<div class="section">In preparation for performing this activity the environment variable <var class="varname">DERBY_HOME</var> needs
to be set and an empty working directory (<samp class="codeph">DERBYDBS</samp>) created.
The <var class="varname">DERBY_HOME</var> variable defines the filesystem path to
the root directory of the Derby installation. The <samp class="codeph">DERBYDBS</samp> directory
is where the files created during the activities are stored.<p>The example
commands defining <var class="varname">DERBY_HOME</var> use the fictitious filesystem
paths <kbd class="userinput">C:\derby</kbd> for Windows examples and <kbd class="userinput">/opt/derby</kbd> for
UNIX examples. Be sure to adjust these commands so <var class="varname">DERBY_HOME</var> indicates
the location of the Derby installation on the system being used. The following
activity sequence shows</p>
 </div>

<ol>
<li><span>Setting the <var class="varname">DERBY_HOME</var> environment variable.</span>
</li>

<li><span>Creating the <samp class="codeph">DERBYDBS</samp> work directory</span></li>

<li><span>Changing the directory (<kbd class="userinput">cd</kbd>) to the work
directory</span></li>

<li><span>Copying the SQL scripts that create the tables and data for toursdb
from the Derby <samp class="codeph">demo\programs\toursdb</samp> subdirectory into the <samp class="codeph">DERBYDBS</samp> directory.</span>
</li>

</ol>

<div class="example">Open a command window and perform the following activity sequence:<dl>

<dt class="dlterm">On Windows platforms:</dt>

<dd><hr /><pre><strong>set DERBY_HOME=C:\derby

md DERBYDBS

cd DERBYDBS

copy %DERBY_HOME%\demo\programs\toursdb\*.sql . </strong>
</pre><hr />
</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">On UNIX Korn Shell platforms:</dt>

<dd><hr /><pre><strong>export DERBY_HOME=/opt/derby

mkdir DERBYDBS

cd DERBYDBS

cp $DERBY_HOME/demo/programs/toursdb/*.sql . </strong>

To help you get up and running with Derby as quickly as possible, this self-study guide highlights some of the more important features of Derby through a series of activities designed to demonstrate the use of Derby in embedded and client-server configurations. After performing these activities, you will find Derby to be an easy to use and fully functional RDBMS. This section provides a brief description of Derby, followed by information on the skills and software required to perform the activities presented in this document, and ends with a brief description of what is presented by each of the Working With Derby activities.">Introduction and prerequisites</a></div>
