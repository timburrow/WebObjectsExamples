<h1 class="topictitle1">Activity 4: Create and run a JDBC program using the Client driver and
Network Server</h1>



<div><p>This section demonstrates the ease with which a program that embeds
Derby can be modified for a client/server implementation using the Derby
Network Server. A Derby client program, <samp class="codeph">WwdClient.java</samp>, is
created by changing a few lines of the <samp class="codeph">WwdEmbedded.java</samp> program.
The client program can be run in multiple command shells allowing simultaneous
update from two or more sources.</p>

<div class="p">This activity assumes you have performed the preceding activities
and so have a working directory called <samp class="codeph">DERBYDBS</samp>, are familiar
with setting the <var class="varname">DERBY_HOME</var> and <var class="varname">CLASSPATH</var> environment
variables and have copies of the program files from the <var class="varname">$DERBY_HOME/demo/programs/workingwithderby/</var> directory.
A basic knowledge of the <samp class="codeph">WwdEmbedded.java</samp> program and experience
starting and connecting to Network Server is helpful. You will need to use
a text editor to create the <samp class="codeph">WwdClient.java</samp> program.</div>

<div class="section">Two command windows (<samp class="codeph">Server-Shell</samp> and <samp class="codeph">Client-Shell</samp>)
are used in this activity. The <samp class="codeph">Server-Shell</samp> is used to start
the Derby Network Server and display Network Server messages. The <samp class="codeph">Client-Shell</samp> is
used to edit, compile and run the newly created <samp class="codeph">WwdClient.java</samp> program.
The <var class="varname">CLASSPATH</var> environment variable is set in <samp class="codeph">Client-Shell</samp> to
support the client JDBC program.</div>

<div class="section"><strong>Activity notes</strong><p>In a client/server environment, the client
program is often used from other computers on the network. Whenever a system
accepts connections from other computers, there is a chance of abuse. To maintain
security, the Derby Network Server defaults to accepting connections only from
clients running on the local machine (<samp class="codeph">localhost</samp>). Before
this or any other Derby client program can access Network Server from another
machine, additional steps should be taken to secure the Network Server environment.
Once secured, the Network Server can be safely configured to accept connections
from other machines. Refer to the <cite>Network Server security</cite> and <cite>Running
the Network Server under the security manager</cite> sections of the <cite>Derby
Server and Administration Guide</cite> for important information on securing
the Network Server and enabling network connections.</p>
<p>With Network Server
started, you can run the client program simultaneously in multiple windows.
To demonstrate this, open two command windows and perform the substeps of the <cite>Run
the client program</cite> step in each window. Both clients will operate
without a problem. In contrast, it would not be possible for a program that
uses the embedded driver (e.g. <samp class="codeph">WwdEmbedded</samp>) to access the
database until the database or the Network Server is shut down. </p>
<p>You
may have noticed that the client program does not shut down the database. This
is because the database is a shared resource in a client/server environment
and, in most cases, should only be shut down when the Server is shut down. If
multiple clients are accessing the database and one shuts down the database,
the remaining clients will encounter a failure the next time they attempt
an SQL command.</p>
<p>Derby's two architectures have caused confusion for
some new Derby users. They mistakenly think that embedded is a single user
configuration. This is not true. The embedded driver supports multiple simultaneous
connections, performs locking, and provides performance, integrity and recoverability.
Any application using the embedded driver can open multiple Derby connections
and then provide a means for multiple users to interact with the database
on each connection. The Derby Network Server is an example of such an application.</p>
