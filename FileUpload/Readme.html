	<P><B>Overview:</B></P>
	<P>This example application demonstrates the creation and use of WOFileUpload elements,
		allowing you to transport files from client machines to your application server (and the
		application, if required).</P>
	<P><B>Usage:</B></P>
	<P>Launch your application with out any special arguments and select a way to upload (or download)
		have to upload a file. For demonstration purposes, some parts of this application are set to render
		images that are uploaded to the application. Since the images are not part of the demo, the uploads
		will be placed in a temporary folder (such as /tmp) rather than in the project folder</P>

	<P><B>Description:</B></P>
	<P>This example uses the dynamic element WOFileUpload to allow a http client to upload a file
		to the server. Specifically it shows how this component can be used from a component based
		action as well as a direct action. This example now includes pages demonstrating streaming uploads,
		as well as streaming downloads. Pages that can be used to upload or download arbitrarily large
		files are so noted in the page descriptions themselves.</P>
