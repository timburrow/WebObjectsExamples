                            This page demonstrates the use of a WOFileUpload component using the 'streamToFilePath' 
			    binding inside of a page using component actions.  This example is designed to take an 
			    uploaded file and then write it directly to disk after is has been submitted.
			    <BR><BR>
			    The 'streamToFilePath' binding is similar to the 'outputStream' binding. It has no 
			    restrictions on its use. It works with two optional bindings:
			    <BR><BR>
			    1) The 'bufferSize' binding helps you adjust the size of the chunks loaded in memory 
			    as the bytes are transfered from the request input stream to your file. By default 
			    'bufferSize' is set to 500 KB. This value is specified in bytes.
			    <BR>
			    2) The 'overwrite' binding lets you specify the behavior to follow if the file already 
			    exists on your system. By default 'overwrite' is set to false.
			    <BR><BR>
			    Note that the usual 'fileName' binding coming from the file upload headers is set 
			    BEFORE this binding is set. So you can use its value to build a file path. This is what 
			    we do in this example.<BR>
			    <BR><BR>
			    Because the file is not displayed or read into memory, this page can be used to 
			    upload arbitrarily large files.
