                        <FONT FACE="Geneva, Arial" SIZE=1>This page demonstrates the use of a WOFileUpload component inside of a page using 
			DirectActions. Note that this page was returned from a directAction, and that all processing of information for this 
			page will also happen via a DirectAction. This example is designed to take any kind of file as an upload and will 
			write it out to disk. The information on the file and it's processing is visible in the console window once you submit 
			the form, so please look there for more information. Note that the file is loaded in an NSData in memory before being 
			written to disk.
