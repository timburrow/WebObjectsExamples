                            This page demonstrates the use of multiple WOFileUpload dynamic elements inside of a
                            page using component actions.  Each WOFileUpload element uses the 'data' binding.
			    This example is designed to take three images
                            as uploaded files and then display their content after is has been submitted.
                            For the example, please upload images of some kind.
			    <BR><BR>
			    The images will be loaded in memory. The three other WOFileUpload bindings: 
			    'outputStream', 'inputStream' and 'streamToFilePath' provide solutions that avoid reading 
			    large files in memory.
			    <BR><BR>
                            If you do not have any images, you can still test the upload by selecting
                            any file (but, obviously, the image will not render).
