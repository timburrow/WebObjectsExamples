	The Hello World application is a simple application that asks you to enter your name. Then it
	displays a personalized message. It's a good example of how to dynamically generate HTML with
	user input.
	<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Usage:</B></P>
	Start the application using project builder . The application then will try to open a browser
	window with the proper URL and so it will establish a connection to the application.
	<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Description:</B></P>
	<P ALIGN=LEFT>The Main component is specified by a template file (Main.html), a declarations
		file (Main.wod), and a java class (defined in Main.java). When a request is made for the
		Main page, WebObjects finds (or instantiates) an object of the Main class, which in turn
		uses the template and declarations file to determine the HTML representation to send to the
		browser. When the user interacts with the page and then submits it, the Main object's
		sayHello method is invoked, creating the next page.<BR>
		The Hello component is similar in design to the Main component, being specified by a
		template file (Hello.html), a declarations file (Hello.wod), and an java object (defined in
		Hello.java). It's function is to display a page containing the name passed in from the Main
		page. It is interesting to observe that the communication between components is being done
		by using &nbsp;key-value coding to pass information between objects without having to
		implement accessor methods<BR>

		Finally, the example shows how to localize a WebObjects application. HelloWorld supports
		English, French, Spanish, German, and Japanese. Change your browser's languages preferences
		to view the different languages.</P></BODY>
