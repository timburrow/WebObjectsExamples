	<B>Topics Covered:</B> Use of the WOLongResponsePage/ Sending mail through the application.
	<P><B>Framework Classes Used:</B> WOExtensions</P>
	<P><B>Reference Site:</B></P>
	<P><B>Overview:</B></P>
	<P>This example application demonstrates the creation and use of long running
		request/response pages which enables web-based applications to perform lengthy tasks while
		providing feedback and means of interruption to the user.</P>
	<P><B>Usage:</B></P>
	<P>Start the application using project builder . The application then will try to open a
		browser window with the proper URL and so it will establish a connection to the
		application.</P>
	<P><B>Description:</B></P>
	<P>When is a request a long one ?</P>
	<P>The developer decides when a request will take a long enough time so that the special
		handling makes sense. For example, when an action is known to take more than 5 seconds.</P>
	<P>How does the developer implement a long request ?</P>
	<P>Only the action part -the business logic- is supposed to take long. The request
		pre-processing and the response generation are assumed to be negligible. Therefore, the
		developer has to encapsulate the expensive code in a separate method.</P>
	<P>We provide the WOLongResponsePage as an abstract subclass of component.The developer
		subclasses it, and implements the component bundle that corresponds to his class.This
		component bundle contains the html template and wod for a &quot;refresh&quot; page. The
		subclassimplements as well at least one method in his subclass :public WOComponent
		performAction()which is the method encapsulating the long lasting calls.</P>
	<P>Another important method in the LongResponsePage is :</P>
	<P>public void setStatus(Object anObject)</P>
	<P>which can be called during the performAction() method to inform any callback of the
		current status of the long computation.If an exception occurs in the long running thread,
		this exception should be put in the status object and the thread should exit. At next
		refresh, the refreshPageForStatus() handles it. This example shows several simple refresh
		pages, with a dummy long action.</P>
	<P>How does it work ?</P>
	<P>Returning will trigger the following sequence of events :</P>
	<P>- executes the performAction() method on MyLRP in a separate thread. </P>
	<P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temporary and final results are set in private ivars of
		WOLongResponsePage until it requested. The method setStatus() enables you to set a temporary
		result while your long action is being processed. Your long action should return the result
		of the long computation. </P>
	<P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before your long action completes, refreshPageForStatus() is
		called after every check for its status, to allow you to return a custom status page. A
		check for status is normally done automatically for you with a meta-refresh tag inserted in
		the WOLongResponsePage (see below), or you can trigger it on an action by calling
		refreshPageForStatus() your self.</P>
	<P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the long action is complete, the next check to occur will
		automatically call pageForResult() to allow you to return a custom result page. </P>
	<P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the cancel() action is ever called while the long action is
		running, then the long action thread is destroyed and the cancelPageForStatus() method to
		allow you to return a custom cancel page.- returns self, which is the developer's
		implementation of a refresh page. </P>
	<P>The LongRequest Example</P>
	<P>Here is a description of the 5 examples of refresh pages in the LongRequest example:</P>
	<P>1.</P>
	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The page can self-refresh at regular or increasing intervals (set
		by setRefreshInterval()) to check for the completion of the computation, display a progress
		bar, etc... When a result page is found in the WOLongResponsePage, it is returned instead of
		self. This should be the most common scheme used.Setting the refreshInterval to non-zero
		forces the super class to add necessary refresh tags for you to the html generated :
		&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV=&quot;Refresh&quot; CONTENT=[time interval in secs]&gt;, so that you do
		not have to bother about it. Of course, this is added only as long as the action is not
		cancelled.</P>
	<P>2.</P>
	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another feature is the possibility for the performAction() task to
		set a status object, which can be just a progress number or some data to display in the
		refreshed page as the computation progresses (this actually simulates a push of data to the
		client).</P>
	<P>3.</P>
	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For longer requests, the page can never refresh, but provide a
		check-in button for the user to come back at will.</P>
	<P>4.</P>
	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LRP also shows a cancel button tied to a cancel action in LRP,
		which switches a flag in the LRP (this flag can be checked in the performAction() loop to
		abort a calculation if possible). For example cancelling could return the refresh page with
		an &quot;Operation Suspended&quot;, or the previous page by implementing
		cancelPageForStatus(), etc...</P>
	<P>5.&nbsp;</P>
	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For extremely long running requests, the page can be the last page
		accessed by the user, and the result page is emailed to him when it is ready, using the new
		mailing feature (see documentation of the WOMailDelivery class).</P></BODY>
