	<P>Most of the interesting code for this example is actually in the WOSessionStoreExample.
		The code within this project merely exercises the WXPersistentSessionStore and related
		classes. Simply launch the app as you would any other WOF application and then begin making
		&quot;guesses&quot; about the secret number. The app will keep track of the guesses you make
		in the session object and will display the current context count. With each guess, your
		session will be written out to disk. If you set your session timeout low , you can actually
		observe the app restoring the session from the archive. Similarly, if you kill/restart the
		app, you will still be able to use the same session you were using before.</P>
	<P><B>Overview:</B></P>
	The PersistentSessionStore application demonstrates one possible alternative session store
	object -- WXPersistentSessionStore. In WebObjects, the session store is the object that
	handles the storage of your session state between requests. The default session store is the
	ServerSessionStore, but that only stores the session while the app is running and cannot deal
	with interruptions in service and consumes virtual memory. The persistent session store
	solves these problems by putting the session on disk as a backup in the event the app dies or
	the in-memory session times out.

	<B>Description:</B>
	<P>Asynchronous Archiving</P>
	<P>At present, there are two subclasses of WXSessionWriter -- WXSynchronousSessionWriter and
		WXAsynchronousSessionWriter. The synchronous session writer is very straightforward and you
		may find it easier to start by looking at this class first. Once you understand what's going
		on with the synchronous version, you may then want to look at the asynchronous version. The
		asynchronous version employs a &quot;write queue&quot; into which are placed NSData objects
		to be written to disk. A separate thread is forked to handle writing these archived
		sessions. When a new session archive is placed in the write queue, the thread which does the
		writing is signalled and the data is written to disk asynchronously.</P>
	<P>Session Timeouts</P>
	<P>The scheme employed by this example allows for sessions to reside in memory and on disk to
		support a fail-over mechanism. To restore a session, we first attempt to get the session
		from the server session store and, if that fails because the session has timed out, then we
		attempt to get the session from disk (via the WXPersistentSessionStore class). The session
		timeout scheme employed by the server session store works the same way it always has in WOF,
		but the time out scheme for archived session is managed by a separate class called
		WXArchiveTimeOutManager.The ArchiveTimeOutManager is a utility class employed by the
		WXSessionWriter superclass. Its job is to periodically scan the session archive directory
		and purge any stale session archives. The user default WOSessionArchiveTimeOut can be used
		to adjust the time which any archived session lives on disk; by default this is set to 86400
		seconds (1 day). The timestamp on the file is used to determine if the file is stale. To
		keep system resource consumption minimal, the scan and purge activity happens on a separate
		thread and is only invoked every 600 seconds (10 minutes); this period is hard coded into
		the class.</P></BODY>
