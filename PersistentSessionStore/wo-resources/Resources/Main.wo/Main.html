							This example application demonstrates the use of a persistent
							session store for a simple number-guessing game.  Using the classes
							in the WOSessionStoreExample framework, this application archives and
							stores the session for each request-response cycle to disk.  The array
							of guesses is stored in the session, and thus it is saved after each
							guess.</FONT>
