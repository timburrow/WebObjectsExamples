	<HR>
	<BR>The WebObjects Java Pet Store Demo is an online pet store. It is a implementation similar to Sun's "Java(TM) Pet Store". Like most e-stores,
you can browse and search the product catalog, choose items to add to a
shopping cart, amend the shopping cart, and order the items in the shopping
cart. You can perform many of these actions without registering with or
logging into the application. However, before you can order items you must
log in (sign in) to the application. In order to sign in, you must have
an account with the application, which is created when you register (sign
up) with the application.

otherwise you are awarded 500 miles. A preferred customer receives an additional
1000 bonus miles. If you have signed in as any user other than the default (j2ee), 
you will receive the additional miles because all newly added users are assigned to the preferred customer group.

orders.&nbsp; This option can only be set when the application is deployed.
