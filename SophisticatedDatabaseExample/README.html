<B>Overview: </B>
<BR>
The SophisticatedDatabaseExample application maintains a simple university
web site that allows students to enroll and sign up for classes.  
The site is administered by an "admin" user who adds and deletes students,
classes, classrooms, and teachers.
The purpose of the example is to demonstrate the more
sophisticated modeling techniques, such as inheritance, flattened attributes
and relationships, and the use of multiple models.
<P>
<B>Usage: </B>
<BR>
The SophisticatedDatabaseExample's eomodel consists of 2 models <I>School</I> 
and <I>Course</I>, with some relationships spanning both models. It is
configured to work with the JDBC adaptor and the OpenBase database
<I>WOSchool</I>.
A script <I>makeDatabaseFromPlist.sh</I> is provided that will populate
the database.
</P>
<P>
The user "logs in" either as a guest ("guest/guest") or as
the administrator ("admin/admin"). The "guest" user is allowed to view
existing courses, enroll as a student, and select courses to study.
The "admin" user maintains the site, and can add, modify, or remove
Students, Teachers, Classrooms, or Courses.
<P>
<B>Description:</B>
<P>
The SophisticatedDatabaseExample demonstrates the use of inheritance,
flattening, and multiple models.
</P>
<P>
The <I>Person</I> class is abstract.
<I>Student</I>, <I>Parent</I> and <I>Employee</I> inherit from <I>Person</I>
using horizontal inheritance. The <I>Admin</I>,<I>Staff</I>, <I>Teacher</I>
classes all inherit from <I>Employee</I> using single-table inheritance.
The <I>HomeAddress</I>, <I>WorkAddress</I>, and <I>BillingAddress</I> inherit
from <I>Address</I> using vertical inheritance.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between Student and ScheduledCourse is an example of a
many-to-many "flattened" relationship. The normal indirect "join" table
values are extracted into each side of the relationship, giving the
appearance of a direct many-to-many relationship between entities(classes).
This relationship is interesting because <I>Student</I> is an entity
in the <I>School</I> model but <I>ScheduledClass</I> is an entity in the
<I>Course</I> model.
