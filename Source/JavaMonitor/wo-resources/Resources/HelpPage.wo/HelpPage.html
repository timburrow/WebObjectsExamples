<blockquote>
    <p>Monitor and wotaskd are part of the WebObjects
    deployment strategy. Each machine that is running a
    WebObjects application should have the WebObjects Task Daemon
    (wotaskd) running on it. To configure these applications for
    deployment, the Monitor application should be run, but
    once configured, only the wotaskds need remain running. Each
    wotaskd is only responsible for all WebObjects applications
    running on the same host. The Web server adaptor (or
    WebObjects HTTP adaptor) communicates with the wotaskds on
    each host to discover what WebObjects applications are
    available. Instances communicate their state to wotaskd
    through the use of TCP lifebeats, while wotaskd controls
    instances through special DirectActions.</p>
    <p><b>Monitor MUST be run from a machine that is both
    running wotaskd AND is a &quot;managed&quot; host. </b></p>
    <p><b>NEVER run more than one Monitor for a set of Hosts.</b></p>
    <p><b>ALWAYS run Monitor and wotaskd behind a firewall.</b></p>

<blockquote>
    A WebObjects application can be accessed 3 ways: <br>
    The first (<code>http://host:2001/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MyApp.woa</code>) is Direct Connect. <br>
    The second (<code>http://host/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MyApp.woa</code>) is through the Web server as a Deployment application. <br>
    The third (<code>http://host/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MyApp.woa/-2001</code>) is through the Web server as a Development application.<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>In Direct Connect, the browser is sending requests and receiving responses directly from the application; the Web server is not involved at all. Resources for the application (images, etc) are served by the application itself. The browser is connected directly to the port (2001 in the example URL) of the application. To use an application in Direct Connect does not require the use of wotaskd or Monitor. </li>
        <li>When accessing a Deployment application through the Web server, a browser sends a request to the Web server (typically port 80). The Web server gives the request to the WebObjects HTTP adaptor, which passes it on to the application. The application's response is returned to the adaptor, which gives it to the Web server, which sends it to the browser. Resources for the application (images, etc) are served by the Web server, which requires a split install. Accessing an application through the adaptor provides several benefits: Pooling of connections, verification of requests, serving of resources, and load-balancing between multiple instances. Typically, applications are deployed through the Web server for security and performance reasons. Deploying an application using Monitor and wotaskd is described below.</li>
        <li>Accessing a Development application through the Web server is similar to accessing a Deployment application, except that load-balancing between instances does not occur. Development applications make it possible to test an application through the Web server without fully deploying it. Accessing a Developer application is described below.</li>

<p><a name="03"><font size="+2"><b>What is Load-balancing?</b></font></a> <a href="#00"><font size="-1">(top)</font></a><br>
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Requests to an application through the Web server are load-balanced
    by the adaptor. In load-balancing, if the request is not
    directed at a specific instance of an application, it is assigned to an
    instance of that application chosen by the adaptor. Load-balancing takes
    place between instances with the same name (cf <code>WOApplicationName</code>).
    The default load-balancing
    scheme is Random, where an instance is chosen arbitrarily,
    but other load-balancing schemes are available. Round Robin
    distributes a request to instances one after another. Load Average
    attempts to balance load to the instances by evenly
    distributing the sessions between instances.</p>

</p>

<blockquote>
    <dl>
        <dt>The HTTP (or Web server) adaptor finds instances
            through one of 3 mechanisms: Multicast, Host List or
            File. By default, Adaptors are configured to use a
            Host List of <code>http://localhost:1085</code>, and
            wotaskds do not respond to multicast. Configuration
            of the various HTTP adaptors is platform-specific,
            and is covered in the adaptor documentation. <BR>NOTE: 
	    if changing the configuration for apache or cgi adaptors
	    delete the WOAdaptorState file, typically located in /tmp/,
	    before starting the Web server again.</dt>
    </dl>
    <p>In Multicast, the adaptor broadcasts a UDP request
    throughout its subnet. wotaskds that receive the request
    respond with their configuration URLs. Once the list of
    configuration URLs is gathered, configuration proceeds as in
    Host List. wotaskds do not respond to multicast broadcasts by
    default. The configuration style is </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><code>webobjects://&lt;multicast address&gt;:&lt;port&gt;&nbsp;&lt;request
        interval&gt;</code></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In Host List, the adaptor requests a configuration file
    from each host in the Host List. The XML file provides a list
    of running Applications and Instances on that wotaskd. The
    configuration format is </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><code>http://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;,http://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;,&lt;etc...&gt;&nbsp;&lt;request
        interval&gt;</code><br>
        <br>
        Host List is the default configuration mode, set to </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><code>http://localhost:1085 10&quot;</code></p>
        </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In File configuration, the adaptor reads an XML file from
    the local file system that describes the application and
    instance configurations. The configuration format is </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><code>file://&lt;path to WOConfig.xml&gt;&nbsp;&lt;request

<blockquote>
    <B>Q:</B> My application is starting on the wrong IP address!<BR>
    <B>A:</B> Use <code>-WOHost &lt;hostname or IP address&gt;</code>. This will force the application to bind  
    to a particular IP address. If you are using Monitor/wotaskd, make sure that  
    both are started with the same <code>-WOHost</code> argument - wotaskd will make sure that  
    any instances it starts will have the correct <code>WOHost</code> setting. <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Q:</B> When I run an application, everything seems fine, but none of my pages get   
    rendered! In particular, everything is returning without the opening bracket (&lt;)  
    in the HTML code. <BR>
    <B>A:</B> You are using an older version of the Java runtime. WebObjects requires at  
    least a 1.3.1 runtime (both the VM and the standard libraries).   <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Q:</B> When I build an application on Windows, and move it to Solaris/MacOSX, it  
    won't run - I get a permission denied error. <BR>
    <B>A:</B> The launch script is probably not executable. Executing the command  
    <code>cd MyApp.woa; chmod a+x Myapp</code> fixes the problem.   <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Q:</B> When I invoke <code>(Application) WOApplication.application()</code>, I get a  
	<code>java.lang.ClassCastException: com.webobjects.appserver.WOApplication</code>. <BR>
    <B>A:</B> In your subclass of WOApplication, you must have the lines: <BR>
	<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
	public static void main(String argv[]) { <BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WOApplication.main(argv, Application.class); <BR>
	}   
	</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BR>
    <B>Q:</B> Applications won't start from Monitor, but they seem to start OK from the  
    command line. <BR>
    <B>A:</B> It's likely that you have a hostname defined in the DNS, and have an IP  
    address, but your <code>/etc/hostconfig</code> lists your hostname as <code>-AUTOMATIC-</code>.  
    Change <code>-AUTOMATIC-</code> to your actual hostname. You need to restart your computer  
    for this to take effect (though a <code>kill -HUP</code> of inetd might work as well).   <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Q:</B> I'm having trouble with the adaptor. How do I get more information about  
    what's happening? <BR>
    <B>A:</B> Enable adaptor logging -- in the temp directory of the HTTP server (/tmp on  
    Solaris/MacOSX, execute <code>echo $TEMP</code> to find it on Win2k) create an empty file named  
    <code>logWebObjects</code>, owned by root. The adaptor log will be created in the same  
    directory, and will be named <code>WebObjects.log</code>. The adaptors do not need to be restarted in  
    order for logging to start or stop.    <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Q:</B> I launch an application instance from Monitor, but the launch fails after 30 secs.  
    Monitor then tries to launch the application again repeatedly, taxing system 
    resources. After a little while, the new instances eventually die, and my original 
    instance eventually comes up. <BR>
    <B>A:</B> Your application likely takes longer than 30 seconds to launch. In Monitor, set 
    Time For Startup to a larger number (roughly the time it takes for your 
    application to start + a little leeway).   <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Q:</B> Can I use 4.5.x and 5.x on the same machine? <BR>
    <B>A:</B> The only supported mixed deployment is 4.5.1 Deployment + 5.x Deployment. No mixed  
    developments are supported. In addition, in a mixed 4.5.1/5.x deployment, only the  
    5.x tools (wotaskd and Monitor) should be used.  <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Q:</B> What is the difference between the 4.5.1 and 5.x HTTP adaptors? <BR>
    <B>A:</B> Only bug-fixes. In general, the most recent adaptors should be used, regardless of 
    whether they are from 4.5.1 or 5.x. Note that versions of the adaptor previous to 
    4.5.1 (i.e. 4.5 and before) are not compatible.   <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Q:</B> My application has a page that takes quite some time to return. Eventually, I get an  
    "No Instance Available" message - how do I fix this? <BR>
    <B>A:</B> You may either use Monitor to increase the read timeout in the adaptor settings  
    to at least the length of time you expect your longest page to take, or use a  
    WOLongResponsePage. Generally, using WOLongResponsePage is the best, as it is more flexible 
    and provides a better user experience. <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Q:</B> My application works fine when I have a developer installation, 
       but I can't connect to it when I have a deployment installation. <BR>
    <B>A:</B> In a deployment install, <code>WODirectConnectEnabled</code> defaults to <code>false</code>, so you won't be able to 
       connect directly -- only through the adaptor. To change this, start your application with 
       <code>-WODirectConnectEnabled true</code>. <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Q:</B> While running my application, it eventually freezes. Before it dies, I see the following debugging logs: <BR>
    <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
    &lt;com.webobjects.appserver._private.WODefaultAdaptor&gt;: Growing number of WOWorkerThreads to 32 <BR>
    &lt;com.webobjects.appserver._private.WODefaultAdaptor&gt;: Growing number of WOWorkerThreads to 64 <BR>
    &lt;com.webobjects.appserver._private.WODefaultAdaptor&gt;: Growing number of WOWorkerThreads to 128 <BR>
    &lt;com.webobjects.appserver._private.WODefaultAdaptor&gt;: Growing number of WOWorkerThreads to 256 <BR>
    </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
    <B>A:</B> WebObjects grows the number of worker threads as the number of concurrent requests increases. However, if your application doesn't finish processing the request, most likely due to a deadlock, the threads will never finish. Thus, the number of threads grows to the allowed maximum, and then the application appears to "freeze".  <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Q:</B> I'm pretty sure I have a deadlock. How do I find out where? <BR>
    <B>A:</B> Bzzt. Still not a deployment question. On MacOS X a quick way to determine whether a deadlock exists is to run your application in Terminal, in the foreground, and when your application deadlocks, press <code>Control-\</code> .   <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Q:</B> Help! I can't access the WOStats page! <BR>
    <B>A:</B> You can set the password (the user is ignored) as an argument: <code>-WOStatisticsPassword myPassword</code> .   <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Q:</B> What happened to the defaults database?! (defaults write...) <BR>
    <B>A:</B> WebObjects 5 uses <code>java.util.Properties</code>. The simplest solution is to use use Properties files. A Properties file is a text file named <code>Properties</code> located in the Resources folder of your WOA bundle and/or frameworks. Inside the file are <code>key=value pairs</code>, one to a line. <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Q:</B> When I try to run any WebObjects 5.x applications on Windows, I get the following error: <BR>
    <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
    com.webobjects.foundation.NSForwardException [java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException] MacRoman
    </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
    <B>A:</B> The Windows English JRE does not have all the character encodings. Use the International JRE or the JDK instead. <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Q:</B> If I am deploying my application in a JSP/Servlet container, do I need wotaskd, Monitor, or the HTTP adaptors? Do I need to have WebObjects installed on the application server? <BR>
    <B>A:</B> If you are deploying in a JSP/Servlet container (such as Tomcat or WebLogic), you do not need (and cannot use) wotaskd, Monitor or the HTTP adaptors. However, WebObjects must be installed on the application server. <BR>
