		<BLOCKQUOTE>
			<P>The Search page allows you to search for movies based on 3 criteria: <i>title</i>, 
			<i>category</i>, and <i>date released</i>.   These three criteria are implicitly 'AND'ed 
			together to create one query.  Therefore, a search for Title='R' and Category='Drama' 
			would search for movies with the Title beginning with 'R' AND Category equal to 'Drama'.</P>
			
			Both the <i>title</i> and <i>category</i> attributes are queried case insensitive.

		<BLOCKQUOTE>
			The Master Index button performs a query of the database returning all movies.  
		</BLOCKQUOTE>

		<A name="ADD"></a>
		<B>Add</B>
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
			The Add page allows you to add a movie to the database.  However, it does not allow 
			you to create relationships to actors and directors.
		</BLOCKQUOTE>

		<A name="VOTING"></a>
		<B>Voting</B>
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
			While viewing a movie, a voting average is displayed.  The voting average characterizes 
			the viewer's rating of the movie based on a scale of zero through ten; Ten being an 
			excellent movie and zero being a very poor movie. 
		</BLOCKQUOTE>

		<A name="REVIEWS"></a>
		<B>Reviews</B>
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
			<P>
			While viewing a movie, a link to its reviews will be displayed.  Click on this link to 
			see the reviews made of this movie.  If you would like to add a review, click on the link 
			'Add a New Review'. 
			</P>
			<P>
			If no reviews exist, then no links will be displayed below the text 'Click a link to 
			select that review'.  When reviews do exist, clicking on these links brings up the review 
			written by that reviewer.
