Launch the Component Element Tour by double-clicking on WOExamples.woa in the <code>/Developer/Examples/JavaWebObjects/WOExamples</code> directory.  Your browser will display an Introduction page with hyperlinks to each of the component element examples.  Within each section, you'll generally use the back arrow button to return to the previous page after clicking on some link or button.

    <P>
    The Component Element Tour allows you to see and try a variety of examples where components are used to re-create the basic functionality of many of the WebObject Framework's built-in dynamic HTML elements. All example components in this tour are created as non-synchronizing components, and they almost all employ WOComponentContent. Furthermore, only the primitive dynamic elements such as WOString, WORepetition, WOConditional, WOGenericElement, and WOGenericContainer are required to recreate any of the basic HTML dynamic elements. These components have the basic functionality of their dynamic elements counterparts but can be easily modified and treated as components.

    Simple Dynamic Elements
    <P>
    ActiveImages, Hyperlink, Image, LocalizedStrings, and Optional Containers examples demonstrate simple dynamic elements.  You can interact with each action-oriented element to see how it feels to the end user.  Each time you click, you will be taken to a different page; simply use the back arrow button to return to this page.
    </p>

    Dynamic Form Elements
    <P>
    Examples of various form-related elements are:
    <ul>
        <li>Browser
        <li>Frames
        <li>Inline Frames
        <li>Multiple Submit Buttons
        <li>PopUp Button
    </ul>
    You may interact with each element in some way (either typing into it or making some choice(s)).  You can see the results by clicking the WOSubmitButton or WOImageButton to submit the form.  The values for every form element will be displayed.  You can use your browser's back arrow button to return to the previous page. 
    </P>

    WOExtensions Elements
    <P>
    The CheckBox List, Nested List, and RadioButton List examples demonstrate three of the more generic WOExtensions components.  There are many more components available in WOExtensions (most of which support DirectToWeb development).  The source for all WOExtensions components is provided with this release.

    If you're using Eclipse and WOLips, you are going to have to enable the Preferences --> WOLips --> PB Server Preferences in order to get WO RapidTurnaround to work and this example to function properly.
